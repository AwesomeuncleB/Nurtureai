## 🌍 The Problem We’re Solving

In Nigeria, **over 34% of births occur without skilled medical attendants**, and maternal mortality remains among the highest globally—**512 deaths per 100,000 live births** (WHO, 2023). In rural and low-income communities, **lack of timely, accurate, and culturally appropriate health information** contributes heavily to these outcomes.

Many women rely on outdated practices or word-of-mouth advice, leading to preventable complications. **Nurture.AI bridges this gap** by using AI and inclusive communication channels to deliver life-saving health knowledge directly to those who need it most.
